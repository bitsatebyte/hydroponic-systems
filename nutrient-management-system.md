# Nutrient Management for Hydroponic Systems

   > Great nutrient management occurs when growers are:
   	1. Aware of all necessary plant nutrients and where they come from
	2. Supplying adequate nutrients in correct ratios to plants
	3. Monitoring and measuring the amount of plant nutrient available in the system at any given point of time
	4. Making economic and work-flow conscous decisions about sourcing and supplying nutrients.


## Chemical Composition for Hydroponics

### Types of nutrient solutions
	1. Inorganic solutions (Pure chemicals)
		+ D.I.Y
		+ Commercial solutions (Liquid or Powder)
	2. Organic solutions
		+ Aquaponics
		+ Compost Tea
		+ Premixed Solutions

#### **Base Nutrients**
	1. Macro Nutrients
		+ *Nitrogen* (N) - Primarily to foliage plant growth - Plant growth and reproduction
		+ *Phosphorous* (P) - Phosphorous helps build strong roots and is vital for flower and seed production - 
		+ *Potassium* (K) - Potassium increases chlorophyll in foliage and helps regulate stomata openings so plants make better use of light and air.
	2. Secondary Nutrients
		+ *Magnesium* (Mg)
		+ *Calcium* (Ca)  
	3. Trace Elements
		+ *Sulphur* (S)
		+ *Iron* (Fe)
		+ *Manganese* (Mn)
		+ *Zinc* (Z)
		+ *Copper* (Cu)
		+ *Boron* (B)
		+ *Molybdenum* (Mo)
