# Nutrient Management for Hydroponic Systems

**Great nutrient management occurs when growers are:**

	1. Aware of all necessary plant nutrients and where they come from
	2. Supplying adequate nutrients in correct ratios to plants
	3. Monitoring and measuring the amount of plant nutrient available in the system at any given point of time
	4. Making economic and work-flow conscious decisions about sourcing and supplying nutrients.


Supplying the correct ratio of nutrients in adequate levels is only half of the nutrient management picture; the other task for farm managers is to keep those nutrients available to plants, and the main factor influencing that availability is pH.


## Chemical Composition for Hydroponics

Most plants rely on 16 nutrients to grow and reproduce. Of these, three are avaialable through Carbon-Dioxide, Hydrogen and Oxygen.

The remaining thirteen nutrients are the mineral nutrients delivered to plants through nutrient solutions.

## Units & Measurements

The overall nutrient level in a solution is measured in EC or electrical conductivity. The units used to measure EC are mS/cm (millisemens per cm). This is often just expressed as the "EC Level". (For example, "The EC of the solution is 1.8", with no unit). Ideal mS/cm is typically between 1.2 and 3.3. There's a broad range of acceptable EC levels, and each crop has an ideal range.

EC essentially measures the amount of soluble salts that are in the water. This helps gauge when to adjust the nutrient solution to maintain an ideal level. Although, the availability is variable depending on pH. pH influences the solubility of nutrients.

The unit used to measure the total dissolved solids is ppm.

## pH Optimization

Adjust pH of the solution using pH Up/Down for maximizing nutrient uptake of plants and to adjust to maximum solubility of nutrients.

pH only ever goes higher than the value we are shooting for or lower than what we are going for.

***NOTE: NEVER USED pH Up, pH Down at the same time***




### Types of nutrient solutions
	1. Inorganic solutions (Pure chemicals)
		+ D.I.Y
		+ Commercial solutions (Liquid or Powder)
	2. Organic solutions
		+ Aquaponics
		+ Compost Tea
		+ Premixed Solutions

#### **Base Nutrients**
	1. Macro Nutrients
		+ _Nitrogen_ (N) - Primarily to foliage plant growth - Plant growth and reproduction
		+ _Phosphorous_ (P) - Phosphorous helps build strong roots and is vital for flower and seed production - 
		+ _Potassium_ (K) - Potassium increases chlorophyll in foliage and helps regulate stomata openings so plants make better use of light and air.
	2. Secondary Nutrients
		+ _Magnesium_ (Mg)
		+ _Calcium_ (Ca)  
	3. Trace Elements
		+ _Sulphur_ (S)
		+ _Iron_ (Fe)
		+ _Manganese_ (Mn)
		+ _Zinc_ (Z)
		+ _Copper_ (Cu)
		+ _Boron_ (B)
		+ _Molybdenum_ (Mo)
